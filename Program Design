Priority:
Attack functions (punch + projectile)
Add second player (with proper controls)
Integrate master files
Animation of as much as possible

BACKGROUND:
Import background image. 
Import platform image. 

Gravity:
Constant acceleration of all sprites downwards. 
Platform is static, thus: 
If sprites are on platform, there is no downward movement.
Else if sprites fall off platform they are carried down by gravity.

SPRITE class:
Left/Right Movement:
Similar to CarSprite demo. 

Jump:
If up arrow or W pressed, sprite displaced by given position. 
Gravity carries sprite back down. 

Punch:
TBD

PROJECTILE class:
When space bar pressed, projectile starts accelerating at constant velocity in one direction, dependent on which way the sprite is facing. 
If projectile hits the hit box of a next sprite within given amount of time, it deletes itself.
  Add damage to enemy (health bar decreases). 
Else if projectile does not hit a hit box within a given amount of time, it deletes itself.
